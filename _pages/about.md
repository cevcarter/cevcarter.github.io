I am a data scientist and mathematics student at Clarkson University. My interests lie in Bayesian treatments of data analysis and machine learning.

Currently I am working for the university on various research projects, including data mining tasks on a large database of protein information and a financial analysis of the university's research activity. I have also completed a data science internship at [Clark Scientific](http://www.clarkscientific.com/), where I developed an effective anomaly detection algorithm to identify bad experimental trials for high-throughput protein analysis.

I do most of my computational and analysis work in Python, and I am also fluent in R and various R API's, such as Shiny. I have also worked in other languages such as C++, Java, MatLab, and a little JavaScript. In Python, I typically use TensorFlow for deep learning, scikit-learn for simple data mining tasks, and PyMC3 with Theano for Inference problems, as well as numpy and scipy for general computation.

If you like what I do, feel free to contact me for networking purposes, if you have a project that you think I could help with, or if you think I might be a good fit for your company.
