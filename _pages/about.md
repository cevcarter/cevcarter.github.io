I am a data scientist and mathematics student at Clarkson University. My interests lie in Bayesian treatments of data analysis and machine learning. 

Currently I am working for the university on various research projects, including data mining tasks on a large database of protein information and a financial analysis of the university's research activity. I have also completed a data science internship at [Clark Scientific](http://www.clarkscientific.com/), where I developed an effective anomaly detection algorithm to identify bad experimental trials for high-throughput protein analysis. 

I do most of my computational and analysis work in Python, and I am also fluent in R and various R API's, such as Shiny. I have also worked in other languages such as C++, Java, MatLab, and a little JavaScript. 

I am passionate about extracting information from data. If you like what I do, feel free to contact me for networking purposes, or if you have a project that you think I could help with.
