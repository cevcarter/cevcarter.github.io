# Explorations in Data-driven Computation

### On this page I feature my skills with machine learning, Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Bayesian Inference, and other computational pattern recognition techniques that I find interesting. 

### I believe that these methods are the future of data analysis, since they are the kinds of techniques necessary to facilitate the complex modeling necessary to solve the difficult problems facing our world.
