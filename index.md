## Welcome!

Here I feature my interests, projects, and experiments regarding data analysis. My work predominantly lies in Bayesian treatments of machine learning and statistics.

Currently, my interests lie in Bayesian nonparametric methods, and Bayesian treatments of machine learning models such as Neural Networks. My work is done in Python, although I am also fluent in R. I am also familiar with other languages, including C++ and Java.

In the future I hope to feature the knowledge I have accumulated from a broad range of disciplines in data analysis, including deep learning using TensorFlow, advanced clustering, and MCMC. I also hope that my work will be worth something to the data science community.
